Conformist and anticonformist bias have been widely documented in humans, and conformist bias has also been observed in many nonhuman animals. Boyd and Richerson used models of conformist and anticonformist bias to explain the evolution of large-scale cooperation, and subsequent research has extended these models. We revisit Boyd and Richerson's original analysis and show that, with conformity based on more than three role models, the evolutionary dynamics can be more complex than previously assumed. For example, we show the presence of stable cycles and chaos under strong anticonformity and the presence of new equilibria when both conformity and anticonformity act at different variant frequencies, with and without selection. We also investigate the case of population subdivision with migration and find that the common claim that conformity can maintain between-group differences is not always true. Therefore, the effect of conformity on the evolution of cooperation by group selection may be more complicated than previously stated. Finally, using Feldman and Liberman's modifier approach, we investigate the conditions under which a rare modifier of the extent of conformity or the number of role models can invade a population. Understanding the dynamics of conformistand anticonformist-biased transmission may have implications for research on human and nonhuman animal behavior, the evolution of cooperation, and frequency-dependent transmission in general. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

This paper approaches this phenomenon from a cultural evolution and cognitive anthropology perspective, focusing on the idea that some cultural traits can be successful because their content taps into general cognitive preferences. This research involves 260 articles from media outlets included in two authoritative lists of websites known for publishing hoaxes and ‘fake news’, tracking the presence of negative content, threat-related information, presence of sexually related material, elements associated to disgust, minimally counterintuitive elements (and a particular category of them, i.e., violations of essentialist beliefs), and social information, intended as presence of salient social interactions (e.g., gossip, cheating, formation of alliances), and as news about celebrities. The analysis shows that these features are, to a different degree, present in most texts, and thus that general cognitive inclinations may contribute to explain the success of online misinformation. This account can elucidate questions such as whether and why misinformation online is thriving more than accurate information, or the role of ‘fake news’ as a weapon of political propaganda. Online misinformation, while being an umbrella term covering many different phenomena, can be characterised, in this perspective, not as low-quality information that spreads because of the inefficiency of online communication, but as high-quality information that spreads because of its efficiency. The difference is that ‘quality’ is not equated to truthfulness but to psychological appeal. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO: VIDI-grant 016.144312","This research was supported by a grant from The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO VIDI-grant 016.144312).

In longitudinal datasets across various domains, covering multiple decades, we find increasing gradients and shortened periods in the trajectories of how cultural items receive collective attention. Is this the inevitable conclusion of the way information is disseminated and consumed? Our findings support this hypothesis. Using a simple mathematical model of topics competing for finite collective attention, we are able to explain the empirical data remarkably well. Our modeling suggests that the accelerating ups and downs of popular content are driven by increasing production and consumption of content, resulting in a more rapid exhaustion of limited attention resources. In the interplay with competition for novelty, this causes growing turnover rates and individual topics receiving shorter intervals of collective attention. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"human behavior; information management; public attitude; real time; social media; Article; computational fluid dynamics; human; mathematical computing; mathematical model; social adaptation; time series analysis; total communication; attention; information dissemination; social media; theoretical model; Attention; Humans; Information Dissemination; Models, Theoretical; Social Media",,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","PLS and PH acknowledge the support by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) in the framework of Collaborative Research Center 910.

One major trend in popular music, as well as other cultural products such as literary fiction, is an increase over time in negatively valenced emotional content, and a decrease in positively valenced emotional content. Here we use two large datasets containing lyrics from n = 4913 and n = 159,015 pop songs respectively and spanning 1965-2015, to test whether cultural transmission biases derived from the cultural evolution literature can explain this trend towards emotional negativity. We find some evidence of content bias (negative lyrics do better in the charts), prestige bias (best-selling artists are copied) and success bias (best-selling songs are copied) in the proliferation of negative lyrics. However, the effects of prestige and success bias largely disappear when unbiased transmission is included in the models, which assumes that the occurrence of negative lyrics is predicted by their past frequency. We conclude that the proliferation of negative song lyrics may be explained partly by content bias, and partly by undirected, unbiased cultural transmission.

Here, we use data on the citation of academic articles and patents, and on the online attention received by songs, movies and biographies, to describe the temporal decay of the attention received by cultural products. We show that, once we isolate the temporal dimension of the decay, the attention received by cultural products decays following a universal biexponential function. We explain this universality by proposing a mathematical model based on communicative and cultural memory, which fits the data better than previously proposed log-normal and exponential models. Our results reveal that biographies remain in our communicative memory the longest (20–30 years) and music the shortest (about 5.6 years). These findings show that the average attention received by cultural products decays following a universal biexponential function. © 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"attention; bibliometrics; cultural anthropology; human; Internet; interpersonal communication; literature; memory; movie; music; patent; physics; theoretical model; time factor; Attention; Bibliometrics; Biography as Topic; Communication; Culture; Humans; Internet; Memory; Models, Theoretical; Motion Pictures; Music; Patents as Topic; Physics; Time Factors",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1748285; MIT Media Lab","C.C. and C.R.-S. acknowledge financial support from Centro de Investigación en Complejidad Social and Universidad del Desarrollo.

However, researchers historically have lacked the population-scale network data needed to verify the predicted weakness. Using data from 11 culturally diverse population-scale networks on four continents—encompassing 56 million Twitter users and 58 million mobile phone subscribers—we find that long-range ties are nearly as strong as social ties embedded within a small circle of friends. These high-bandwidth connections have important implications for diffusion and social integration. © 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Theory suggests that individuals should be selective in what, when, and whom they copy, by following 'social learning strategies’ (SLSs). The SLS concept has stimulated extensive experimental work, integrated theory, and empirical findings, and created impetus to the social learning and cultural evolution fields. However, the SLS concept needs updating to accommodate recent findings that individuals switch between strategies flexibly, that multiple strategies are deployed simultaneously, and that there is no one-to-one correspondence between psychological heuristics deployed and resulting population-level patterns. The field would also benefit from the simultaneous study of mechanism and function. SLSs provide a useful vehicle for bridge-building between cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and evolutionary biology. © 2018",asocial information; associative learning theory; behavioural gambit; cumulative culture; metacognition; social information,Biology; asocial information; Associative learning; behavioural gambit; Metacognition; Social information; Learning systems; adult; article; associative learning; cultural anthropology; experimental study; female; heuristics; human; human experiment; male; metacognition; neuroscience; psychology; social learning; theoretical study; writing; animal; associative learning; brain; imitation; metacognition; physiology; social learning; Animals; Association Learning; Brain; Culture; Humans; Imitative Behavior; Metacognition; Social Learning,,,,,"John Templeton Foundation, JTF: 40128, 60501; Royal Society",Research supported in part by two John Templeton Foundation grants ( 60501 ; 40128 ) to K.N.L. and a Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin fellowship to N.J.B.

From gathering around the camp-fire telling tales of ancestors to watching the latest television box-set, humans are inveterate producers and consumers of stories. Despite its ubiquity, little attention has been given to understanding the function and evolution of storytelling. Here we explore the impact of storytelling on hunter-gatherer cooperative behaviour and the individual-level fitness benefits to being a skilled storyteller. Stories told by the Agta, a Filipino hunter-gatherer population, convey messages relevant to coordinating behaviour in a foraging ecology, such as cooperation, sex equality and egalitarianism. These themes are present in narratives from other foraging societies. We also show that the presence of good storytellers is associated with increased cooperation. In return, skilled storytellers are preferred social partners and have greater reproductive success, providing a pathway by which group-beneficial behaviours, such as storytelling, can evolve via individual-level selection. We conclude that one of the adaptive functions of storytelling among hunter gatherers may be to organise cooperation. © 2017 The Author(s).",,cooperative behavior; fitness; human evolution; hunter-gatherer; individual variation; reproductive success; cooperation; ecology; foraging; human; narrative; organization; reproductive success; storytelling; adolescent; adult; aged; cooperation; ethnology; evolution; female; male; middle aged; Philippines; verbal communication; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Biological Evolution; Cooperative Behavior; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Narration; Philippines; Young Adult,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 249347; Leverhulme Trust: RP2011-R-045; European Research Council, ERC","This project was funded by the Leverhulme Trust grant RP2011-R-045 to A.B.M. and R.M.

Yet, recent cultural trends run in the opposite direction. Using the Google Books corpus, coupled with two metadata-rich corpora of Anglophone fiction books, we show a decrease in emotionality in English-speaking literature starting plausibly in the nineteenth century. We show that this decrease cannot be explained by changes unrelated to emotionality (such as demographic dynamics concerning age or gender balance, changes in vocabulary richness, or changes in the prevalence of literary genres), and that, in our three corpora, the decrease is driven almost entirely by a decline in the proportion of positive emotion-related words, while the frequency of negative emotion-related words shows little if any decline. Consistently with previous studies, we also find a link between ageing and negative emotionality at the individual level. © 2016 The Author(s).

It argues that morally ambiguous protagonists navigate conflicts between prosocial and antisocial motivational pulls. In so doing they present audiences with a window onto the conflicts inherent in human sociality. Working from this premise, the article analyzes the morally ambiguous protagonist Walter White from the TV series Breaking Bad, complementing the analysis with survey results. The article finally discusses critically the role of moral disengagement in enjoyment of stories with morally ambiguous protagonists. © 2017, Academic Studies Press.

Little is known, however, of how common such experiences are, nor the individual differences they may reflect. Here we present the results of a 2014 survey conducted in collaboration with a national UK newspaper and an international book festival. Participants (n = 1566) completed measures of reading imagery, inner speech, and hallucination-proneness, including 413 participants who provided detailed free-text descriptions of their reading experiences. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that reading imagery was related to phenomenological characteristics of inner speech and proneness to hallucination-like experiences. However, qualitative analysis of reader's accounts suggested that vivid reading experiences were marked not just by auditory phenomenology, but also their tendency to cross over into non-reading contexts. This supports social-cognitive accounts of reading while highlighting a role for involuntary and uncontrolled personality models in the experience of fictional characters. © 2017 The Authors",Creativity; Hallucinations; Imagery; Inner speech; Theory-of-mind,"adult; aged; Article; character; cognition; female; hallucination; human; imagery; information; information service; male; personal experience; phenomenology; publication; publishing; qualitative analysis; questionnaire; reading; short survey; speech; United Kingdom; voice; adolescent; hallucination; imagination; middle aged; physiology; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Hallucinations; Humans; Imagination; Male; Middle Aged; Reading; Young Adult",,,,,"Wellcome Trust, WT: WT098455, WT108720","Angela Woods and Joe Campbell are thanked for assistance with devising questions and survey programming.

One focuses on naturally selected preferences (Evolutionary Aesthetics), while the other describes a process of evaluative coevolution whereby preferences coevolve with signals. Signaling theory suggests that expertise moderates these mechanisms. In this article we set out to verify this hypothesis in the domain of art and use it to elucidate Western modern art’s deviation from naturally selected preferences. We argue that this deviation is consistent with a Coevolutionary Aesthetics mechanism driven by prestige-biased social learning among art experts. In order to test this hypothesis, we conducted two studies in which we assessed the effects on lay and expert appreciation of both the biological relevance of the given artwork’s depicted content, viz., facial beauty, and the prestige specific to the artwork’s associated context (MoMA). We found that laypeople appreciate artworks based on their depictions of facial beauty, mediated by aesthetic pleasure, which is consistent with previous studies. In contrast, experts appreciate the artworks based on the prestige of the associated context, mediated by admiration for the artist. Moreover, experts appreciate artworks depicting neutral faces to a greater degree than artworks depicting attractive faces. These findings thus corroborate our contention that expertise moderates the Evolutionary and Coevolutionary Aesthetics mechanisms in the art domain. Furthermore, our findings provide initial support for our proposal that prestige-driven coevolution with expert evaluations plays a decisive role in modern art’s deviation from naturally selected preferences. After discussing the limitations of our research as well as the relation that our results bear on cultural evolution theory, we provide a number of suggestions for further research into the potential functions of expert appreciation that deviates from naturally selected preferences, on the one hand, and expertise as a moderator of these mechanisms in other cultural domains, on the other. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Art appreciation; Coevolutionary aesthetics; Evolutionary aesthetics; Expertise; Modern art; Prestige bias,coevolution; cultural anthropology; esthetics; face; human; human experiment; pleasure; social learning; art; emotion; esthetics; evolution; Art; Biological Evolution; Emotions; Esthetics; Humans,,,,,"Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO: G085012 N","Many thanks to the members of the Behavioral Engineering Group Research and the Centre for Marketing and Consumer Science at the University of Leuven for commenting on these studies on various occasions.

Attention is an essential component of this construct: People often report feeling that they have focused attention into a narrative world, and disengaged attention from the physical environment. The goal of our research was to test if people’s attention is captured in a dynamic fashion over the course of narrative experiences. To achieve this goal, we used excerpts from narrative films. One way in which filmmakers command viewers’ attention is by generating suspense, which arises when viewers confront potential negative outcomes. In our experiments, we tested the hypothesis that hot spots, moments at which potential negative outcomes are emphasized, will narrow the viewer’s attentional focus compared to cold spots, moments that do not emphasize negative outcomes. We measured attentional tuning through latencies in reaction time to audio probes as participants viewed suspenseful film excerpts. We also administered post-viewing recognition memory tests for still images taken from hot and cold spots. Across three experiments, participants missed more probes and exhibited slower reaction times during suspenseful hot spots than cold spots. These findings provide evidence for changes in attentional tuning as people view film narratives.

This transformation results from the preferential survival of certain types of information and the resolution of ambiguity. Here we present evidence of a bias favoring the social transmission of negatively-valenced information across multiple transmission episodes. Ninety-two, four-person chains transmitted a story containing unambiguously positive and unambiguously negative story events, along with ambiguous story events that could be interpreted positively or negatively. Analysis using mixed-effects modeling revealed the preferential survival of unambiguously negative events over positive events, and the increasingly negative resolution of ambiguous events across successive transmission episodes. Contrary to predictions, elevated state anxiety did not enhance the social transmission of negatively-valenced information. We also found that the survival of unambiguously negative story events was positively correlated with the negative resolution of ambiguous story events, reflecting a general negativity-bias in the social transmission of information. © 2016",Anxiety; Cultural attraction; Cultural evolution; Cultural selection; Negativity bias; Serial reproduction; Social transmission,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Acerbi, A., Mesoudi, A., If we are all cultural Darwinians what's the fuss about?

From the biocultural perspective, cultural processes are rooted in the biological necessities of the human life cycle: specifically human forms of birth, growth, survival, mating, parenting, and sociality. Conversely, from the biocultural perspective, human biological processes are constrained, organized, and developed by culture, which includes technology, culturally specific socioeconomic and political structures, religious and ideological beliefs, and artistic practices such as music, dance, painting, and storytelling. Establishing biocultural theory as a program that self-consciously encompasses the different particular forms of human evolutionary research could help scholars and scientists envision their own specialized areas of research as contributions to a coherent, collective research program. This article argues that a mature biocultural paradigm needs to be informed by at least 7 major research clusters: (a) gene-culture coevolution;(b) human life history theory; (c) evolutionary social psychology; (d) anthropological research on contemporary hunter-gatherers; (e) biocultural socioeconomic and political history; (f) evolutionary aesthetics; and (g) biocultural research in the humanities(religions, ideologies, the history of ideas, and the arts). This article explains the way these research clusters are integrated in biocultural theory, evaluates the level of development in each cluster, and locates current biocultural theory within the historical trajectory of the social sciences and the humanities. © 2015 American Psychological Association.",Biocultural theory; Consilience; Evolutionary psychology; Geneculture coevolution; Human evolution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, J., (1996) The reality of illusion: An ecological approach to cognitive film theory, , Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University Press; Barkow, J.H., Cosmides, L., Tooby, J., (1992) The adapted mind: Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Baron-Cohen, S., Autism: The empathizingsystemizing (E-S) theory (2009) Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1156, pp. 68-80. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04467.x; Baumeister, R.F., (2005) The cultural animal: Human nature, meaning, and social life, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195167030.001.0001, Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Baumeister, R.F., Masicampo, E.J., Vohs, K.D., Do conscious thoughts cause behavior (2011) Annual Review of Psychology, 62, pp. 331-361. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.psych.093008.131126; Bickerton, D., (2009) Adam's tongue: How humans made language, how language made humans, , New York, NY: Hill and Wang; Binford, L.R., (2001) Constructing frames of reference: An analytical method for archaeological theory building using hunter-gatherer and environmental data sets, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Bjorklund, D.F., Pellegrini, A.D., (2002) The origins of human nature: Evolutionary developmental psychology, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/10425-000, Washington, DC: American Psychological Association; Boehm, C., Hierarchy in the forest: The evolution of egalitarian behavior (1999) Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.

Our ability to communicate relies in part upon a shared emotional experience, with stories often following distinct emotional trajectories and forming patterns that are meaningful to us. Here, by classifying the emotional arcs for a filtered subset of 1,327 stories from Project Gutenberg’s fiction collection, we find a set of six core emotional arcs which form the essential building blocks of complex emotional trajectories. We strengthen our findings by separately applying matrix decomposition, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. For each of these six core emotional arcs, we examine the closest characteristic stories in publication today and find that particular emotional arcs enjoy greater success, as measured by downloads. © 2016, Reagan et al.",language; narratology; sentiment mining; society; stories,Natural language processing systems; Building blockes; Emotional experiences; language; Matrix decomposition; narratology; NAtural language processing; society; stories; Big data,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1447634",PSD and CMD acknowledge support from NSF Big Data Grant #1447634.,,,,,,,,,,"Pratchett, T., Stewart, I., Cohen, J., (2003) The science of Discworld II: the globe, , Ebury Press, London; Campbell, J., (2008) The hero with a thousand faces, , New World Library, Novato; Gottschall, J., (2013) The storytelling animal: how stories make us human, , Mariner Books, New York; http://www.ted.com/talks/stephen_cave_the_4_stories_we_tell_ourselves_about_death, Cave S (2013) The 4 stories we tell ourselves about death; http://nautil.us/issue/5/fame/homo-narrativus-and-the-trouble-with-fame, Dodds PS (2013) Homo narrativus and the trouble with fame.

To understand how those patterns of preference changed across a century, we gathered two samples of English-language poetry from the period 1820-1919: one drawn from volumes reviewed in prominent periodicals and one selected at random from a large digital library (in which the majority of authors are relatively obscure). The stylistic differences associated with literary prominence turn out to be quite stable: a statistical model trained to distinguish reviewed from random volumes in any quarter of this century can make predictions almost as accurate about the rest of the period. The ""poetic revolutions"" described by many histories are not visible in this model; instead, there is a steady tendency for new volumes of poetry to change by slightly exaggerating certain features that defined prestige in the recent past. © 2016 by University of Washington.",Distant reading; Literary prestige; Literary reviewing; Longue durée; Poetic diction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, A., Things of boundaries (1995) Social Research, 62 (4), pp. 857-882; Algee-Hewitt, M., Allison, S., Gemma, M., Heuser, R., Moretti, F., Walser, H., (2016) Canon/Archive: Large-Scale Dynamics in the Literary Field, , litlab.stanford.edu/LiteraryLabPamphlet11, January; Algee-Hewitt, M., McGurl, M., (2015) Between Canon and Corpus: Six Perspectives on Twentieth-Century Novels, , litlab.stanford.edu/LiteraryLabPamphlet8, January; Bourdieu, P., (1995) The Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field, , translated by Susan Emanuel.

People who read it improve their understanding of others. This effect is especially marked with literary fiction, which also enables people to change themselves. These effects are due partly to the process of engagement in stories, which includes making inferences and becoming emotionally involved, and partly to the contents of fiction, which include complex characters and circumstances that we might not encounter in daily life. Fiction can be thought of as a form of consciousness of selves and others that can be passed from an author to a reader or spectator, and can be internalized to augment everyday cognition. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",consciousness; empathy; inference; mental models; reading,Association reactions; Consciousness; Empathy; Inference; Mental model; Reading; Cognitive systems; brain; cognition; comprehension; consciousness; empathy; human; human experiment; imagination; model; theory of mind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Republic (1955), Penguin.

Its main aim is to isolate the factors involved in maintaining behavioural lineages over time, and to understand how these factors might interact. In doing so, it takes issue with the abstract and idealised models and arguments of dual-inheritance theorists, which are alleged in this account to rely on an overly simplistic notion of imitative learning. Morin’s book is full of ethnographic, anthropological, and psychological research, and there is much to commend in it. However, Morin’s arguments against the dual-inheritance theorists are less convincing when put under scrutiny, and his positive picture which includes appeals to ostensive communication, intrinsic appeal and cultural attraction has some difficulties. I argue that when we contrast dual-inheritance theorists and Morin, we find that there may be fewer differences and greater commonalities than Morin’s book might suggest. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Cultural evolution; Dual-inheritance; Imitation; Niche construction,culture; learning; psychology; research; theoretical study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Acerbi, A., Mesoudi, A., If we are all cultural Darwinians what’s the fuss about?

Two categories of models are proposed for the dispersal of non-Africans: (1) single dispersal, i.e., a single major diffusion of modern humans across Eurasia and Australasia [3-5]; and (2) multiple dispersal, i.e., additional earlier population expansions that may have contributed to the genetic diversity of some present-day humans outside of Africa [6-9]. Many variants of these models focus largely on Asia and Australasia, neglecting human dispersal into Europe, thus explaining only a subset of the entire colonization process outside of Africa [3-5, 8, 9]. The genetic diversity of the first modern humans who spread into Europe during the Late Pleistocene and the impact of subsequent climatic events on their demography are largely unknown. Here we analyze 55 complete human mitochondrial genomes (mtDNAs) of hunter-gatherers spanning ∼35,000 years of European prehistory. We unexpectedly find mtDNA lineage M in individuals prior to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). This lineage is absent in contemporary Europeans, although it is found at high frequency in modern Asians, Australasians, and Native Americans. Dating the most recent common ancestor of each of the modern non-African mtDNA clades reveals their single, late, and rapid dispersal less than 55,000 years ago. Demographic modeling not only indicates an LGM genetic bottleneck, but also provides surprising evidence of a major population turnover in Europe around 14,500 years ago during the Late Glacial, a period of climatic instability at the end of the Pleistocene. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",,"ancient DNA; mitochondrial DNA; Africa; Black person; Caucasian; Europe; genetic variation; genetics; haplotype; human; human genome; migration; mitochondrial genome; Africa; African Continental Ancestry Group; DNA, Ancient; DNA, Mitochondrial; Emigration and Immigration; Europe; European Continental Ancestry Group; Genetic Variation; Genome, Human; Genome, Mitochondrial; Haplotypes; Humans",,"DNA, Ancient; DNA, Mitochondrial",,,"StG 283503; Wenner-Gren Foundation: 7837; College of Behavioral and Social Sciences, Coppin State University, CBSS; European Research Council, ERC: 283503; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: KR 4015/1-1; Ministry of Science,Technology and Research, MoSTR","We are grateful for comments from Stephan Schiffels, Hugo Reyes-Centeno, David Reich, Maria Spyrou, Henrike Heyne, Heidi Colleran, and members of the Department of Archaeogenetics of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, as well as the three anonymous reviewers.

Skous Vej 4, Aarhus, 8000, Denmark","This article argues that the sciences of mind can inform analyses of narrative characters, including their motives, appearances, and other traits. In particular, it explores the popcultural villain through the lenses of evolutionary and social psychology. Evolutionary psychology supplies a basic blueprint for impactful villains: they are selfish, exploitative, and sadistic. They contravene the prosocial ethos of society. Social psychology embeds this blueprint in the interactions of characters by offering mechanisms through which cruel behavior may be realized. The main mechanisms behind moral disengagement are empathic deficits, pseudospeciation, and Baumeister's notion of a 'myth of pure evil': an attributive stance whereby humans consider injurious actions the products of evil essences in others. Finally, disgust may contribute to a character's perceived evil nature through dehumanization, likely compounded by a cognitive conflation of disgust toward potential contaminants and moral disgust toward social transgressions. Following the theoretical discussion, the article offers 5 predictions as to the universal makeup of popcultural villains. All predictions are complemented with illustrative vignettes on popcultural villains that embody the principles proposed. © 2015 American Psychological Association.",Agonistic structure; Darwinian criticism; Evil; Evolutionary psychology; Narrative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andrews, D., The rape-revenge film: Biocultural implications (2012) Jump Cut, 54, pp. 1-4. , http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc54.2012/DAndrewsRapeRevenge, Retrieved from; Andrews, P.W., The psychology of social chess and the evolution of attribution mechanisms: Explaining the fundamental attribution error (2001) Evolution and Human Behavior, 22, pp. 11-29. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1090-5138(00)00059-3; Axelrod, R., Hamilton, W.D., The evolution of cooperation (1981) Science, 211, pp. 1390-1396. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.7466396; Bandura, A., Moral disengagement in the perpetration of inhumanities (1999) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 3, pp. 193-209. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327957pspr0303_3; Baron-cohen, S., (2012) The science of evil: On empathy and the origins of cruelty, , New York, NY: Basic Books; Baumeister, R.F., (2001) Evil: Inside human violence and cruelty, , New York, NY: Holt Paperbacks; Blatty, W.P., (2011) The exorcist, , (40th anniversary ed.).

For the sound-era movies of both sets there is little evidence indicating anything other than a linear decline plotted on a logarithmic scale, with the English-language set providing stronger results. In a subsample of 24 English-language movies from 1940 to 2010 the decline in shot duration is uniform across 15 shot classes, a result that supports a broad ""evolutionary"" account of film change. The article also explores the proportions of these shot classes across years and genres, with the results showing that 25 percent of the decline in shot duration is due to a shift away from shot classes with longer-than-average shot durations towards those with shorterthan- average durations, and 8 percent of the decline is due to the increased use of shot scales in which characters appear larger. © Berghahn Books.",Cultural differences; Genre; Historical change; Intensified continuity; Movies; Pace; Shot duration; Shot/reverse-shot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alderman, L., Hwang, K.O., Does Technology Cause ADHD?

Although previous research has reported conditions that suppress peripheral visual processing, no prior work has investigated how attention changes in response to the variable emotional content of audiovisual narratives. We used fMRI to test for the suppression of spatially peripheral stimuli and enhancement of narrative-relevant central stimuli at moments when suspense increased in narrative film excerpts. Participants viewed films presented at fixation, while flashing checkerboards appeared in the periphery. Analyses revealed that increasing narrative suspense caused reduced activity in peripheral visual processing regions in the anterior calcarine sulcus and in default mode network nodes. Concurrently, activity increased in central visual processing regions and in frontal and parietal regions recruited for attention and dynamic visual processing. These results provide evidence, using naturalistic stimuli, of dynamic spatial tuning of attention in early visual processing areas due to narrative context. © 2015 IBRO.",Attention; Cognitive neuroscience;

A full-fedged scientifc approach to literary criticism should incorporate the kind of work being done by Franco Moretti at the Stanford Literary Laba quantitative analysis of the history of literary form. While Moretti and the literary Darwinists are almost never mentioned together, I contend that their work is not only compatible but also necessarily so for a more consilient literary criticism. The Darwinian aesthetics promoted by Denis Dutton can help to unite these two approaches. © 2014 The Johns Hopkins University Press.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Carroll, J., (2004) Literary Darwinism, , New York: Routledge; (2011) Reading Human Nature, , Albany: SUNY Press; Boyd, B., (2009) On the Origin of Stories, , Cambridge: Harvard University Press; (2012) Why Lyrics Last, , Cambridge: Harvard University Press; Gottschall, J., (2008) Literature, Science, and a New Humanities, , New York: Palgrave Macmillan; (2012) The Storytelling Animal, , Boston: Houghton Miffin; (2010) Evolution, Literature, and Film: A Reader, , Brian Boyd, Joseph Carroll, and Jonathan Gottschall New York: Columbia University Press; Dutton, D., (2009) The Art Instinct: Beauty, Pleasure, and Human Evolution, , New York: Bloomsbury Press, hereafter abbreviated AI; Kramnick, J., Against literary darwinism (2011) Critical Inquiry, 37, pp. 315-347; Tooby, J., Cosmides, L., The psychological foundations of culture (1992) The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture, pp. 19-136. , Jerome Barkow, Leda Cosmides, and John Tooby New York: Oxford University Press; Gottschall, J., The tree of knowledge and darwinian literary study (2003) Philosophy and Literature, 27, pp. 255-268; Carroll, Reading Human Nature, p. 78; Carroll, Literary Darwinism, p. 19; Boyd, On the Origin of Stories, pp. 222-223; Dawkins, R., (1976) The Selfsh Gene, pp. 189-201. , New York: Oxford University Press; Lumsden, C.J., Wilson, E.O., Translation of Epigenetic Rules of Individual Behavior into Ethnographic Patterns (1980) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 77, pp. 4382-4386; Wilson, E.O., (1999) Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge, p. 148. , New York: Vintage; Wilson, E.O., Foreword from the Scientifc Side (2005) The Literary Animal: Evolution and the Nature of Narrative, pp. vii-xi. , Jonathan Gottschall and David Sloan Wilson Evanston: Northwestern University Press, p. ix; Carroll, Literary Darwinism, p. xiv; Reading Human Nature, pp. 45-46; Boyd, B., 'Jane, Meet Charles': Literature, Evolution, and Human Nature (1998) Philosophy and Literature, 22, pp. 1-30. , 11; Lovejoy, A.O., (1936) The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea, p. 18. , New York: Harper; Moretti, F., (2007) Graphs, Maps, Trees: Abstract Models for Literary History, , New York: Verso; Allison, S., Heuser, R., Jockers, M., Moretti, F., Witmore, M., Quantitative formalism: An experiment (2011) Literary Lab, Pamphlet, 1. , January, Reprinted in n+1 13 Winter 2012:81-108; Moretti, F., Evolution, World-Systems, Weltliteratur (2006) Studying Transcultural Literary History, pp. 113-121. , Gunilla Lindberg-Wada Berlin: de Gruyter; Moretti, Graphs, Maps, Trees, p. 1; Lakatos, I., Falsifcation and the Methodology of Scientifc Research Programmes (1970) Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge, pp. 91-196. , Imre Lakatos and Alan Musgrave Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Boyd, On the Origin of Stories, p. 391; Gottschall, Tree of Knowledge, p. 260; Boyd, Jane, Meet Charles, p. 22; Vermeule, B., (2010) Why Do We Care About Literary Characters?, , Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, hereafter abbreviated WDW; Moretti, Graphs, Maps, Trees, p. 82; Boyd, B., On the Origin of Comics: New York Double-Take (2010) Evolutionary Review, 1, pp. 97-111; Boyd, Why Lyrics Last, p. 132; Boyd, B., Literature and Science: Doomed Reductionism or Evolutionary Literary Pluralism?

Here we argue that it is helpful to distinguish between several distinct phases of the transmission process in which cultural selection can operate, such as a choose-toreceive phase, an encode-and-retrieve phase, and a choose-to-transmit phase. Here we focus on emotional selection in cultural transmission of urban legends, which has previously been shown to operate in the choose-to-transmit phase. In a series of experiments we studied serial transmission of stories based on urban legends manipulated to be either high or low on disgusting content. Results supported emotional selection operating in all three phases of cultural transmission. Thus, the prevalence of disgusting urban legends in North America may be explained by emotional selection through a multitude of pathways. © 2014 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.",cultural transmission; disgust; emotion and memory; Emotional selection; serial reproduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andrade, E.B., Cohen, J.B., On the consumption of negative feelings (2007) Journal of Consumer Research, 34, pp. 283-300; Bangerter, A., Transformation between scientific and social representations of conception: The method of serial reproduction (2000) British Journal of Social Psychology, 39, pp. 521-535; Barrett, J.L., Nyhof, M.A., Spreading non-natural concepts: The role of intuitive conceptual structures in memory and transmission of cultural materials (2001) Journal of Cognition and Culture, 1, pp. 69-100; Bartlett, F.C., (1932) Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Baumeister, R.F., Vohs, K.D., Dewall, C.N., Zhang, L., How emotion shapes behavior: Feedback, anticipation, and reflection, rather than direct causation (2007) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 11, pp. 167-203; Berger, J., Arousal increases social transmission of information (2011) Psychological Science, 22, pp. 891-893; Bower, G.H., How might emotions affect learning? in Christianson, S.A.

This article demonstrates that how-to screenwriting manuals both feed into and exemplify the new cultural economy and the position(s) of creative labor within that economy by offering the opportunity to dream up and invent one's own career and providing blueprints for doing so. The article draws on a critical discourse analysis study of a selection of the most popular manuals and analyzes the discursive strategies the texts deploy to concretize aspects of screenwriting labor, from story structure and formatting to pitching and rewriting. The manuals are discussed as a type of psy-technology and as a sophisticated form of professional self-help, and they are also analyzed as precarious governmental tools that shape industries, practices, and subjects but in ambiguous and chaotic ways. © The Author(s) 2012.",film; labor; precarity; production studies; psy-technologies; screenwriting manuals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aronson, L., (2001) Screenwriting Updated: New (And Conventional) Ways of Writing for the Screen, , Los Angeles, CA: Silman-James Press;; Banks, M., (2007) The Politics of Cultural Work, , London: Palgrave Macmillan;; Berlant, L., Cruel Optimism (2006) Differences, 17 (3), pp. 20-36; Boltanski, L., Chiapello, E., (2005) The New Spirit of Capitalism, , New York: Verso;; Bonnet, J., (2006) Stealing Fire from the Gods: The Complete Guide to Story for Writers and Filmmakers, , Studio City, CA: Michael Wiese Productions;; Born, G., (2005) Uncertain Vision: Birt, Dyke and the Reinvention of the BBC, , London: Vintage;; Caldwell, J.T., (2008) Production Culture: Industrial Reflexivity and Critical Practice in Film and Television, , Durham: Duke University Press;; Chiapello, E., Fairclough, N., Understanding the New Management Ideology: A Transdisciplinary Contribution from Critical Discourse Analysis and New Sociology of Capitalism (2002) Discourse & Society, 13 (2), pp. 185-208; Christopherson, S., Beyond the Self-Expressive Creative Worker: An Industry Perspective on Entertainment Media (2008) Theory, Culture and Society, 25 (78), pp. 73-95; Couldry, N., Littler, J., Work, Power and Performance: Analysing the 'Reality' Game of (2011) The Apprentice Cultural Sociology, 5 (2), pp. 263-279; Cowgill, L., (1999) Secrets of Screenplay Structure: How to Recognize and Emulate the Structural Frameworks of Great Films, , Los Angeles, CA: Lone Eagle Publishing;; Dancyger, K., Rush, J., (2002) Alternative Scriptwriting: Successfully Breaking the Rule, , 2002.

Theories of justice highlight 2 motives for punishment: a forward-looking deterrence of future norm violations and a backward-looking retributive desire to harm. Previous studies of costly punishment have not isolated how much people are willing to pay for retribution alone, because typically punishment both inflicts damage (satisfying the retributive motive) and communicates a norm violation (satisfying the deterrence motive). Here, we isolated retributive motives by examining how much people will invest in punishment when the punished individual will never learn about the punishment. Such ""hidden"" punishment cannot deter future norm violations but was nevertheless frequently used by both 2nd-party victims and 3rd-party observers of norm violations, indicating that retributive motives drive punishment decisions independently from deterrence goals. While self-reports of deterrence motives correlated with deterrence-related punishment behavior, self-reports of retributive motives did not correlate with retributive punishment behavior. Our findings reveal a preference for pure retribution that can lead to punishment without any social benefits. © 2014 The Author(s).",Deterrence; Punishment; Retaliation; Retribution; Social norms,female; human; human relation; male; motivation; psychology; punishment; social justice; social norm; trust; young adult; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Motivation; Punishment; Social Justice; Social Norms; Trust; Young Adult,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 295642",,,,,,,,,,,"Balliet, D., Mulder, L., Van Lange, P.A.M., Reward, punishment, and cooperation: A meta-analysis (2011) Psychological Bulletin, 137, pp. 594-615; Batson, C.D., Kennedy, C.L., Nord, L.-A., Stocks, E.L., Fleming, D.A., Marzette, C.M., Zerger, T., Anger at unfairness: Is it moral outrage?

In Study 1, data from the World Values Survey (World Values Survey Association, 2009) provided 1st evidence of a negative association between age and the self-reported wish to be rich. Ecological concerns, a form of contributing to the public good, were positively related to age. Study 2 investigated whether these values are expressed behaviorally when participants solved a complex problem that allowed striving for monetary gains or contributing to a public good. Confirming hypotheses, young adults' strategies were consistent with the aim of optimizing personal financial gain, and older adults' strategies with the aim to contribute to the public good. Studies 3 and 4 showed that older adults were more likely than younger and middle-aged adults to donate money to a good cause than to keep it for themselves. Study 4 manipulated participants' future time perspective as a factor potentially contributing to agerelated differences. Partly confirming hypotheses, a longer time perspective reduced donations by older adults, but a shorter time perspective did not increase donations by younger adults. These studies suggest that older adults not only report valuing contributions to the public good more highly but also are more likely to behave altruistically than younger adults. All studies used cross-sectional designs that prevent a strict test of developmental trajectories but rather provide age-related differences at 1 point in time, representing a 1st step in investigating adult age-related differences in altruism. © 2013 American Psychological Association.",Adult development; Altruism; Ecology; Materialism; Values,"adolescent; adult; age; aged; aging; altruism; cross-sectional study; female; human; human development; male; middle aged; problem solving; psychologic test; psychology; social welfare; social welfare; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Altruism; Charities; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Human Development; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Problem Solving; Psychological Tests; Social Welfare; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Batson, C.D., Shaw, L.L., Evidence for altruism: Toward a pluralism of prosocial motives (1991) Psychological Inquiry, 2, pp. 107-122; Blanchard-Fields, F., Jahnke, H.C., Camp, C., Age differences in problem-solving style: The role of emotional salience (1995) Psychology and Aging, 10, pp. 173-180; Blanchard-Fields, F., Mienaltowski, A., Seay, R.B., Age differences in everyday problem-solving effectiveness: Older adults select more effective strategies for interpersonal problems (2007) Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Science, 62, pp. P61-P64; Brandtstädter, J., Rothermund, K., Krantz, D., Kühn, W., Final decentrations: Personal goals, rationality perspectives, and the awareness of life's finitude (2010) European Psychologist, 15, pp. 152-163; Buss, D.M., (1999) Evolutionary psychology: The new science of the mind, , Boston, MA: Allyn & Bacon; Carstensen, L.L., Isaacowitz, D.M., Charles, S.T., Taking time seriously: A theory of socioemotional selectivity (1999) American Psychologist, 54, pp. 165-181; Cornelius, S.W., Caspi, A., Everyday problem solving in adulthood and old age (1987) Psychology and Aging, 2, pp. 144-153; Diener, E., Suh, E.M., Lucas, R.E., Smith, H.L., Subjective well-being: Three decades of progress (1999) Psychological Bulletin, 125, pp. 276-302; Eagly, A.H., Chaiken, S., (1993) The psychology of attitudes, , Fort Worth, TX: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich; Ebner, N.C., Freund, A.M., Baltes, P.B., Developmental changes in personal goal orientation from young to late adulthood: From striving for gains to maintenance and prevention of losses (2006) Psychology and Aging, 21, pp. 664-678; Erikson, E.H., (1982) The life cycle completed, , New York, NY: Norton; Frederick, S., Loewenstein, G., Hedonic adaptation (1999) Well-being: The foundation of hedonic psychology, pp. 302-329. , In D.

Anthropocentric perspectives in aesthetics prevent the recognition of the ontological complexity of the aesthetics of nature, and the aesthetic agency of many non-human organisms. The process of evaluative coevolution is shared by all biotic advertisements. I propose that art consists of a form of communication that coevolves with its own evaluation. Art and art history are population phenomena. I expand Arthur Danto's Artworld concept to any aesthetic population of producers and evaluators. Current concepts of art cannot exclusively circumscribe the human arts from many forms of non-human biotic art. Without assuming an arbitrarily anthropocentric perspective, any concept of art will need to engage with biodiversity, and either recognize many instances of biotic advertisements as art, or exclude some instances of human art. Coevolutionary aesthetic theory provides a heuristic account of aesthetic change in both human and biotic artworlds, including the coevolutionary origin of aesthetic properties and aesthetic value within artworlds. Restructuring aesthetics, art criticism, and art history without human beings at the organizing centers of these disciplines stimulate new progress in our understanding of art, and the unique human contributions to aesthetics and aesthetic diversity. © 2013 The Author(s).",Aesthetic evolution; Aesthetics of nature; Aposematism; Art; Mate choice; Ornament,art; coevolution; esthetics; mate choice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abramović, M., Thompson, C.W., Weslien, K., PURE RAW: performance, pedagogy and (re)presentation (2005) PAJ J Perform Art, 28, pp. 29-50; Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton: Princeton University Press; Barker, F.K., Cibois, A., Schikler, P., Felsenstein, J., Cracraft, J., Phylogeny and diversification of the largest avian radiation (2004) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 101, pp. 11040-11045; Beatty, J.H., The evolutionary contingency thesis (2006) Conceptual Issues in Evolutionary Biology, , E.

Robert A. Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land (1961), Frank Herbert's Dune (1968), and Arthur C. Clarke's novelization of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) each offer a superficial critique of imperial expansion and colonial occupation; despite this, however, all three portray inward psychic voyages in imperial terms, and each text replaces or augments the conquest of outer space with a central focus on the conquest of inner space. Inner space explorations offer a way of freeing the racially unmarked male subject from the repressive internal colonization of the mind; in this sense, Fanon's notion of psychic decolonization is appropriated in the service of the Western privilege it opposes in its intended context. © 2000-2013 ITHAKA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahluwalia, P., Zegege, A., Frantz fanon and steve biko: Towards liberation (2001) Social Identities, pp. 455-469. , 7.3; Attebery, B., (2002) Decoding Gender in Science Fiction, , New York: Routledge; Blackford, R., Neo-Bible and Ur-Text: The 'Original Uncut' STRANGER in A STRANGE LAND (1991) Foundation, 53, pp. 70-80; Blackmore, T., Talking with 'Strangers': Interrogating the Many Texts that Became Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land (1995) Extrapolation, pp. 136-151. , 36.2; Cherniavsky, E., (2006) Incorporations: Race, Nation, and the Body Politics of Capital, , Minneapolis, U of Minnesota P; Clarke, A.C., (1968) 2001: A Space Odyssey, , New York: Penguin; Csicsery-Ronay Jr., I., Science fiction and empire (2003) SFS, pp. 231-245. , 30.2 (July); Dekoven, M., (2004) Utopia Limited: The Sixties and the Emergence of the Postmodern, , Durham, NC: Duke UP; Deleuze, G., Guattari, F., (1980) A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia, , Trans.

This paper presents a case study consistent with this ""cognitive attraction"" hypothesis. Numerous studies show that direct eye-gaze catches the attention of adults and newborns. Adults find it more attractive. We explore one possible cultural consequence of this cognitive appeal. Among XVIth century European portraits, direct-gaze paintings are more likely to be featured in today's art books. In Renaissance Europe, the proportion of paintings that stare at the viewer grows gradually, strongly, and remains prevalent for centuries. A demographic analysis of this shift shows that it was due to the arrival of new generations of painters. Those artists show a preference for direct-gaze portraits as soon as they start painting, suggesting that they acquired the new style in the years of their apprenticeship. The preferences of those painters and of contemporary art critics seem consistent with the innate attentional bias that favours direct-gaze faces. The structure of the ""Renaissance gaze shift"" bears evidence for the importance of demographic turn-over in cultural change. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Art history; Cognitive attraction; Cultural selection; Direct eye-gaze; Renaissance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Beyer, A., (2003) Portraits: a history, , Harry N.

One social-learning mechanism derived from cultural evolutionary theory is prestige bias, which allows a learner in a novel environment to quickly and inexpensively gather information as to the potentially best teachers, thus maximizing his or her chances of acquiring adaptive behavior. Learners provide deference to high-status individuals in order to ingratiate themselves with, and gain extended exposure to, that individual. We examined prestige-biased social transmission in a laboratory experiment in which participants designed arrowheads and attempted to maximize hunting success, measured in caloric return. Our main findings are that (1) participants preferentially learned from prestigious models (defined as those models at whom others spent longer times looking), and (2) prestige information and success-related information were used to the same degree, even though the former was less useful in this experiment than the latter. We also found that (3) participants were most likely to use social learning over individual (asocial) learning when they were performing poorly, in line with previous experiments, and (4) prestige information was not used more often following environmental shifts, contrary to predictions. These results support previous discussions of the key role that prestige-biased transmission plays in social learning.",Cultural evolution; Individual learning; Prestige bias; Social learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., (1985) Culture and the evolutionary process, , Chicago: University of Chicago Press; Chudek, M., Heller, S., Birch, S., Henrich, J., Prestige-biased cultural learning: Bystander's differential attention to potential models influences children's learning (2012) Evolution and Human Behavior, 33, pp. 46-56; Eriksson, K., Enquist, M., Ghirlanda, S., Critical points in current theory of conformist social learning (2007) Journal of Evolutionary Psychology, 5, pp. 67-87; Hendrickx, J., Ganzeboom, H.B.G., Occupational status attainment in the Netherlands, 1920-1990: A multinomial logistic analysis (1998) European Sociological Review, 14, pp. 387-403; Henrich, J., Boyd, R., The evolution of conformist transmission and the emergence of between-group differences (1998) Evolution and Human Behavior, 19, pp. 215-241; Henrich, J., Broesch, J., On the nature of cultural transmission networks: Evidence from Fijian villages for adaptive learning biases (2011) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 366, pp. 1139-1148; Henrich, J., Gil-White, F.J., The evolution of prestige: Freely conferred deference as a mechanism for enhancing the benefits of cultural transmission (2001) Evolution and Human Behavior, 22, pp. 165-196; Henrich, J., Henrich, N., The evolution of cultural adaptations: Fijian food taboos protect against dangerous marine toxins (2010) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 277, pp. 2715-3724; Henrich, J., McElreath, R., The evolution of cultural evolution (2003) Evolutionary Anthropology, 12, pp. 123-135; Heyes, C.M., Social learning in animals: Categories and mechanisms (1994) Biological Reviews, 69, pp. 207-231; Kameda, T., Nakanishi, D., Cost-benefit analysis of social/cultural learning in a nonstationary uncertain environment: An evolutionary simulation and an experiment with human subjects (2002) Evolution and Human Behavior, 23, pp. 373-393; Kameda, T., Nakanishi, D., Does social/cultural learning increase human adaptability (2003) Evolution and Human Behavior, 24, pp. 242-260; Kirkpatrick, L.A., Ellis, B.J., What is the evolutionary significance of self-esteem?

Many consumers pay hard-earned money to be scared witless by films, books, and computer games. The well-told horror story can affect even the most obstinate skeptic. How and why does horror fiction work? Why are people so fascinated with monsters? Why do horror stories generally travel well across cultural borders, if all they do is encode salient culturally contingent anxieties, as some horror scholars have claimed? I argue that an evolutionary perspective is useful in explaining the appeal of horror, but also that this perspective cannot stand alone. An exhaustive, vertically integrated theory of horror fiction incorporates the cultural dimension. I make the case for a biocultural approach, one that recognizes evolutionary underpinnings and cultural variation. © 2012 American Psychological Association.",Biocultural analysis; Evolutionary psychology; Fear; Horror fiction; Monsters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arnett, J.J., Sensation seeking, aggressiveness, and adolescent reckless behavior (1996) Personality and Individual Differences, 20, pp. 693-702. , doi:10.1016/0191-8869(96)00027-X; Asma, S.T., On monsters: An unnatural history of our worst fears (2009), Oxford, England: Oxford University Press; Barber, P., (1988) Vampires, burial, and death: Folklore and reality, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Barrett, H.C., Adaptations to predators and prey (2005) Handbook of evolutionary psychology, pp. 200-223. , D.

People use language in part to convey emotional information, leading to the central and contingent questions: (1) What is the emotional spectrum of natural language? and (2) Are natural languages neutrally, positively, or negatively biased? Here, we report that the human-perceived positivity of over 10,000 of the most frequently used English words exhibits a clear positive bias.

Here we discuss the potential of this model in explaining the mechanisms underlying aesthetic experiences. Traditionally art appreciation has been associated with concepts such as harmony, perceptual fluency, and the so-called good Gestalt. We observe that more often than not great artworks blatantly violate these characteristics. Using the concept of prediction error from the predictive coding approach, we attempt to resolve this contradiction. We argue that artists often destroy predictions that they have first carefully built up in their viewers, and thus highlight the importance of negative affect in aesthetic experience. However, the viewer often succeeds in recovering the predictable pattern, sometimes on a different level. The ensuing rewarding effect is derived from this transition from a state of uncertainty to a state of increased predictability. We illustrate our account with several example paintings and with a discussion of art movements and individual differences in preference. On a more fundamental level, our theorizing leads us to consider the affective implications of prediction confirmation and violation.

Yet few studies have investigated how changes in cultural products correspond to changes in psychological traits and emotions. The current research fills this gap by testing the hypothesis that one cultural product-word use in popular song lyrics-changes over time in harmony with cultural changes in individualistic traits. Linguistic analyses of the most popular songs from 1980-2007 demonstrated changes in word use that mirror psychological change. Over time, use of words related to self-focus and antisocial behavior increased, whereas words related to other-focus, social interactions, and positive emotion decreased. These findings offer novel evidence regarding the need to investigate how changes in the tangible artifacts of the sociocultural environment can provide a window into understanding cultural changes in psychological processes. © 2011 American Psychological Association.",Birth-cohort; Cultural products; Linguistic Inquiry Word Count; Meta-analysis; Song lyrics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adams, G., Markus, H.R., Toward a conception of culture suitable for a social psychology of culture (2004) The psychological foundations of culture, pp. 335-360. , Erlbaum, Mahwah, NJ, C.S.

What explains this? Some authors have suggested a neurocognitive change took place, leading to a creative explosion, although this has been contested. Here, we examine the hypothesis that demographic changes caused cultural ""cumulative adaptive evolution"" and as such the emergence of modern symbolic behavior. This approach usefully explains the evolution of utilitarian skills and tools, and the creation of symbols to identify groups. However, it does not equally effectively explain the evolution of behaviors that may not be directly adaptive, such as the production of iconic representations like figurines and rock art. In order to shed light on their emergence, we propose to combine the above-mentioned cultural hypothesis with the concept of sensory exploitation. The concept essentially states that behavioral traits (in this case iconic art production) which exploit pre-existing sensory sensitivities will evolve if not hindered by costs (i.e., natural selection). In this view, iconic art traditions are evolved by piggy-backing on cumulative adaptive evolution. Since it is to date uncertain whether art has served any adaptive function in human evolution, parsimony demands paying more attention to the primary and afunctional mechanism of sensory exploitation as opposed to mechanisms of models based exclusively on secondary benefits (such as Miller's, for instance, in which art is proposed to evolve as a sexual display of fitness). © Springer-Verlag 2010.",Cultural transmission; Demographic transition; Evolution of art; Iconic representations; Mimicry; Sensory exploitation,"adaptation; animal; art; article; behavior; cultural anthropology; demography; evolution; genetic selection; human; mate choice; reproductive fitness; sensation; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Art; Behavior; Biological Evolution; Cultural Evolution; Demography; Genetic Fitness; Humans; Mating Preference, Animal; Selection, Genetic; Sensation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ambrose, S.H., Chronology of the later stone age and food production in East Africa (1998) J Archaeol Sci, 25, pp. 377-392; Ambrose, S.H., Late pleistocene human population bottlenecks, volcanic winter, and differentiation of modern humans (1998) J Hum Evol, 34, pp. 623-651; Arak, A., Enquist, M., Hidden preferences and the evolution of signals (1993) Phil Trans R Soc B, 340, pp. 207-213; Arnqvist, G., Sensory exploitation and sexual conflict (2006) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 361 (1466), pp. 375-386. , DOI 10.1098/rstb.2005.1790; Bar-Yosef, O., The upper paleolithic revolution (2002) Annu Rev Anthropol, 31, pp. 363-393; Bednarik, R.G., A figurine from the African acheulian (2003) Curr Anthropol, 44 (3), pp. 405-413; Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., (1985) Culture and the Evolutionary Process, , The University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., (2005) The Origin and Evolution of Cultures, , The University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Brumm, A., Moore, M.W., Symbolic revolutions and the Australian archaeological record (2005) Camb Archaeol J, 15, pp. 157-175. , doi:10.1017/S0959774305000089; Coe, K., (2003) The Ancestress Hypothesis: Visual Art as Adaptation, , Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick; Conard, N.J., Palaeolithic ivory sculptures from South-Western Germany and the origins of figurative art (2003) Nature, 426, pp. 830-832; Conard, N.J., A female figurine from the basal aurignacian of hohle fels cave in southwestern Germany (2009) Nature, 459, pp. 248-252. , doi:10.1038/nature07995; Dart, R.A., The waterworn pebble of many faces from Makapansgat (1974) S Afr J Sci, 70, pp. 167-169; Darwin, C., (1871) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, 2. , John Murray, London (Reprinted in 1952 by Encyclopedia Britannica); Debeaune, S.A., White, R., Ice-age lamps (1993) Sci Am, 268, pp. 108-113; Delporte, H., Paleolithic lamp found at cave-of-Lascaux (1977) Rev Louvre mus Fr, 27, pp. 94-96; Dissanayake, E., Homo sestheticus (1992) Where art Comes from and Why, , University of Washington Press, Seattle; Dissanayake, E., Birth of the arts (2001) Nat Hist, 109, pp. 84-91; Endler, J.A., Basolo, A.L., Sensory ecology, receiver biases and sexual selection (1998) Trends Ecol Evol, 13, pp. 415-420; Floss, H., Rouquerol, N., (2007) Les Chemins de l'Art Aurignacien en Europe/Das Aurignacien und die Anfänge der Kunst in Europa, , éditions Musée-forum Aurignac, Aurignac; Fuller, R.C., Houle, D., Travis, J., Sensory bias as an explanation for the evolution of mate preferences (2005) Am Nat, 166, pp. 437-446; Goren-Inbar, N., A figurine from the acheulean site of Berekhat Ram (1986) J Isr Prehist Soc, 19, pp. 7-12; Guilford, T., Dawkins, M.S., Receiver psychology and the evolution of animal signals (1991) Anim Behav, 42, pp. 1-14; Henrich, J., Demography and cultural evolution: How adaptive cultural processes can produce maladaptive losses - The Tasmanian case (2004) Am Antiq, 69, pp. 197-214; Hodgson, D., Understanding the origins of Paleoart: The neurovisual resonance theory and brain functioning (2006) Paleoanthropology, 2006, pp. 54-67; Huffman, M.A., Quiatt, D., Stone handling by Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata): Implications for tool use of stone (1986) Primates, 27, pp. 413-423; Arkush, E., Stanish, C., Interpreting conflict in the ancient Andes: Implications for the archaeology of warfare (2005) Current Anthropology, 46 (1), pp. 3-28. , DOI 10.1086/425660; Kellert, S.R., Wilson, E.O., (1993) The Biophilia Hypothesis, , Island Press, Washington; Klein, R., Archaeology and the evolution of human behavior (2000) Evol Anthropol, 9, pp. 17-36; Kohn, M., Mithen, S., Handaxes: Products of sexual selection?

The first approach considers such memory advantages to be a property of the concepts themselves while the second approach emphasizes the role played by the context in which such concepts appear in allowing a reader to make sense of them. The context-based view also suggests that counterintuitive concepts lose their advantages as they become widely accepted and embedded in a cultural milieu. In the new context, ideas with enhanced counterintuitiveness obtain transmission advantages. This ratcheting up of counterintuitiveness helps explain cultural innovation and dynamism. It also allows us to account for the development and spread of complex cultural ideas such as the overly counterintuitive religious concepts including the Judeo-Christian-Islamic conceptions of God. © 2009.",Cognition and culture; Cognitive science of religion; Semantic memory,Christians; Cognitive science; Context-based; Semantic memory; Semantics; Cognitive systems; article; concept analysis; concept formation; concept mapping; conceptual framework; cultural anthropology; cultural factor; human; nonhuman; priority journal; process model; religion; semantic memory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, J.R., (1990) The adaptive character of thought, , Lawrence Erlbaum, Hillsdale, NJ; Anderson, J.R., Labiere, C., (1998) Atomic components of thought, , Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ; Atran, S., (2004) In Gods we trust: Evolutionary landscape of religion, , Oxford University Press, Oxford, MA; Bainbridge, W.S., (1985) Cultural genetics, religious movements, pp. 157-198. , Paragon, New York; Bainbridge, W.S., Stark, R., Cult formation: Three compatible models (1979) Sociological Analysis, 40 (4), pp. 283-291; Barkow, J., Cosmides, L., Tooby, J., (1995) The adapted mind: Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture, , Oxford University Press, New York; Barrett, J.L., Coding and quantifying counterintuitiveness in religious concepts: Theoretical and methodological reflections (2008) Method and Theory in the Study of Religion, 20, pp. 308-338; Barrett, J., Nyhof, M., Spreading non-natural concepts: The role of intuitive conceptual structures in memory and transmission of cultural materials (2001) Cognition and Culture, 1, pp. 69-100; Beecher, H.W., (1887) A summer in England with Henry Ward Beecher, , Ford Howard, & Hulbert, London, UK; Bloch, M., Are religious beliefs counter-intuitive (2005) Essays on cultural transmission, pp. 103-123. , Berg, New York, M.

We challenge the view that language grammars are unrelated to social environments in which they are learned and used. Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a statistical analysis of >2,000 languages using a combination of demographic sources and the World Atlas of Language Structures- a database of structural language properties. We found strong relationships between linguistic factors related to morphological complexity, and demographic/socio-historical factors such as the number of language users, geographic spread, and degree of language contact. The analyses suggest that languages spoken by large groups have simpler inflectional morphology than languages spoken by smaller groups as measured on a variety of factors such as case systems and complexity of conjugations. Additionally, languages spoken by large groups are much more likely to use lexical strategies in place of inflectional morphology to encode evidentiality, negation, aspect, and possession. Our findings indicate that just as biological organisms are shaped by ecological niches, language structures appear to adapt to the environment (niche) in which they are being learned and used. As adults learn a language, features that are difficult for them to acquire, are less likely to be passed on to subsequent learners. Languages used for communication in large groups that include adult learners appear to have been subjected to such selection. Conversely, the morphological complexity common to languages used in small groups increases redundancy which may facilitate language learning by infants. Conclusions/Significance: We hypothesize that language structures are subjected to different evolutionary pressures in different social environments. Just as biological organisms are shaped by ecological niches, language structures appear to adapt to the environment (niche) in which they are being learned and used. The proposed Linguistic Niche Hypothesis has implications for answering the broad question of why languages differ in the way they do and makes empirical predictions regarding language acquisition capacities of children versus adults. © 2010 Lupyan, Dale.",,article; atlas; conjugation; cultural factor; data base; demography; ecological niche; evolutionary adaptation; geography; human; hypothesis; interpersonal communication; language; linguistics; morphology; organism; prediction; social environment; social structure; speech therapy; adult; child; social behavior; Adult; Child; Demography; Humans; Language; Social Behavior,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 0720322, 0826825",,,,,,,,,,,"Gordon, R.G., Ethnologue: Languages of the World (2005) Fifteenth, , 15th Edition, SIL International; Wray, A., Grace, G., The consequences of talking to strangers : Evolutionary corollaries of socio-cultural influences on linguistic form (2007) Lingua, 117, pp. 543-578; Evans, N., Levinson, S., The Myth of Language Universals: Language diversity and its importance for cognitive science (2009) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, , In press; Greenberg, J.H., (1966) Universals of language, , MIT Press; Dahl, O., (2004) The Growth and Maintenance of Linguistic Complexity, , John Benjamins Publishing Co; Hawkins, J.A., (1986) A Comparative Typology of English and German: Unifying the Contrasts, , Univ of Texas Press; McWhorter, J., (2007) Language Interrupted: Signs of Non-Native Acquisition in Standard Language Grammars, , USA: Oxford University Press; Payne DL, Payne TE (1990) Yagua.

Here, by incorporating direct human assessment of words, we quantify happiness levels on a continuous scale for a diverse set of large-scale texts: song titles and lyrics, weblogs, and State of the Union addresses. Our method is transparent, improvable, capable of rapidly processing Web-scale texts, and moves beyond approaches based on coarse categorization. Among a number of observations, we find that the happiness of song lyrics trends downward from the 1960s to the mid 1990s while remaining stable within genres, and that the happiness of blogs has steadily increased from 2005 to 2009, exhibiting a striking rise and fall with blogger age and distance from the Earth's equator. © 2009 The Author(s).",Blogs; Emotion; Happiness; Hedonometer; Measurement; Remote sensing; Song lyrics; State of the Union addresses; Written expression,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 0846668",,,,,,,,,,,"Argyle, M., (2001) The Psychology of Happiness, , 2nd edn., New York: Routledge; Bellezza, F.S., Greenwald, A.G., Banaji, M.R., Words high and low in pleasantness as rated by male and female college students (1986) Behavior Research Methods, Instruments & Computers, 18, pp. 299-203; Cohn, M.A., Mehl, M.R., Pennebaker, J.W., Linguistic markers of psychological change surrounding September 11, 2001 (2004) Psychological Science, 15, pp. 687-693; Conner Christensen, T., Feldman Barrett, L., Bliss-Moreau, E., Lebo, K., Kaschub, C., A practical guide to experience-sampling procedures (2003) Journal of Happiness Studies, 4, pp. 53-78; Csikszentmihalyi, M., (1990) Flow, , New York: Harper & Row; Csikszentmihalyi, M., Larson, R., Prescott, S., The ecology of adolescent activity and experience (1977) Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 6, pp. 281-294; Diener, E., Emmons, R.A., The independence of positive and negative affect (1984) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 47, pp. 1105-1117; Dodds, P.S., Watts, D.J., Universal behavior in a generalized model of contagion (2004) Physical Review Letters, 92. , Article #218701; Easterlin, R., Does economic growth improve the human lot?

With regard to afterlife beliefs, the hypothesis of Cartesian substance dualism as the intuitive folk position fails to have the explanatory power with which its proponents endow it. It is argued that the embedded corollary assumptions of the intuitive Cartesian substance dualist position (that the mind and body are different substances, that the mind and soul are intensionally identical, and that the mind is the sole source of identity) are not compatible with cultural representations such as mythologies, funerary rites, iconography and doctrine as well as empirical evidence concerning intuitive folk reasoning about the mind and body concerning the afterlife. Finally, the article suggests an alternative and more parsimonious explanation for understanding intuitive folk representations of the afterlife. © Koninklijke Brill NV, 2008.",Afterlife beliefs; Cartesian substance dualism; Intentional stance; Intuitive; Mind-body problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Antonietti, A., Corradiini, A., Lowe, E.J., Psycho-physical Dualism Today: An Interdisciplinary Approach, , press, Lexington Books, Lanham, MD; Astuti, R., Are we natural dualists?

Because of the prominence of these counterintuitive concepts in religious belief systems, Boyer's theory features prominently in many cognitive treatments of religion. Difficulties in identifying what are and are not counterintuitive concepts in this technical sense, however, has made empirical treatment of Boyer's theory irregular and difficult to evaluate. Further, inability to quantify just how counterintuitive a given concept is has made ambiguous specifying where the alleged cognitive optimum lies. The present project attempts to clarify Boyer's theory and presents a formal system for coding and quantifying the ""counterintuitiveness"" of a concept, and hence, facilitates empirical scrutiny of the theory. © 2008 Brill Academic Publishers.",Cognitive science of religion; Counterintuitive; Cultural transmission; Religious concepts,,,,,,"John Templeton Foundation, JTF","1 T he author thanks Pascal Boyer, Emma Cohen, Joe Henrich, Nicola Knight, Anders Lis-dorf, Brian Malley, Bob McCauley, Tenelle Porter, and Rich Sosis for comments and suggestions.

This bias is argued to serve critical evolutionarily adaptive functions, but its developmental presence and ontogenetic emergence have never been seriously considered. The authors argue for the existence of the negativity bias in early development and that it is evident especially in research on infant social referencing but also in other developmental domains. They discuss ontogenetic mechanisms underlying the emergence of this bias and explore not only its evolutionary but also its developmental functions and consequences. Throughout, the authors suggest ways to further examine the negativity bias in infants and older children, and they make testable predictions that would help clarify the nature of the negativity bias during early development. © 2008 American Psychological Association.",affective asymmetry; emotion; negativity bias; social referencing; social-cognitive development,affect; article; child development; cognition; concept formation; human; infant; perception; social behavior; Affect; Child Development; Cognition; Concept Formation; Humans; Infant; Social Behavior; Social Perception,,,,,"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD: R29HD035707",,,,,,,,,,,"Abelson, R.P., Kanouse, D.E., Subjective acceptance of verbal generalizations (1966) Cognitive consistency, pp. 173-199. , Feldman S.

We have explored this question experimentally by artificially inverting the true popularity of songs in an online ""music market,"" in which 12,207 participants listened to and downloaded songs by unknown bands. We found that most songs experienced self-fulfilling prophecies, in which perceived - but initially false - popularity became real over time. We also found, however, that the inversion was not self-fulfilling for the market as a whole, in part because the very best songs recovered their popularity in the long run. Moreover, the distortion of market information reduced the correlation between appeal and popularity, and led to fewer overall downloads. These results, although partial and speculative, suggest a new approach to the study of cultural markets, and indicate the potential of web-based experiments to explore the social psychological origin of other macrosociologlcal phenomena.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adler, M., Stardom and Talent (1985) American Economic Review, 75 (1), pp. 208-212; Aizen, J., Huttenlocher, D., Kleinberg, J., Novak, A., Traffic-based Feedback on the Web (2004) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 101 (SUPP. 1), pp. 5254-5260; Apesteguia, J., Maier-Rigaud, F.P., The Role of Rivalry: Public Goods Versus Common-Pool Resources (2006) Journal of Conflict Resolution, 50 (5), pp. 646-663; Asch, S.E., (1952) Social Psychology, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Becker, H.S., (1982) Art Worlds, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Biggs, M., Self-Fulfilling Prophecies The Oxford Handbook of Analytical Sociology, , Forthcoming, edited by Peter Bearman and Peter Hedström.

The effect of positive mood states was measured in two different cognitive domains: semantic search (remote associates task) and visual selective attention (Eriksen flanker task). In the conceptual domain, positive affect enhanced access to remote associates, suggesting an increase in the scope of semantic access. In the visuospatial domain, positive affect impaired visual selective attention by increasing processing of spatially adjacent flanking distractors, suggesting an increase in the scope of visuospatial attention. During positive states, individual differences in enhanced semantic access were correlated with the degree of impaired visual selective attention. These findings demonstrate that positive states, by loosening the reins on inhibitory control, result in a fundamental change in the breadth of attentional allocation to both external visual and internal conceptual space. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Attention;

One hypothesis is that this feature of human eyes evolved to make it easier for conspecifics to follow an individual's gaze direction in close-range joint attentional and communicative interactions, which would seem to imply especially cooperative (mututalistic) conspecifics. In the current study, we tested one aspect of this cooperative eye hypothesis by comparing the gaze following behavior of great apes to that of human infants. A human experimenter ""looked"" to the ceiling either with his eyes only, head only (eyes closed), both head and eyes, or neither. Great apes followed gaze to the ceiling based mainly on the human's head direction (although eye direction played some role as well). In contrast, human infants relied almost exclusively on eye direction in these same situations. These results demonstrate that humans are especially reliant on eyes in gaze following situations, and thus, suggest that eyes evolved a new social function in human evolution, most likely to support cooperative (mututalistic) social interactions. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This was tested by passing social and non-social information along multiple chains of participants. Experiment I found that gossip, defined as information about intense third-party social relationships, was transmitted with siginificantly greater accuracy and in significantly greater quantity than equivalent non-social information concerning individual behaviour or the physical environment. Experiment 2 replicated this finding controlling for narrative coherence, and additionally found that information concerning everyday non-gossip social interactions was transmitted just as well as the intense gossip interactions. It was therefore concluded that human cultural transmission is biased toward information concerning social interactions over equivalent non-social information. © 2006 The British Psychological Society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bangerter, A., Transformation between scientific and social representations of conception: The method of serial reproduction (2000) British Journal of Social Psychology, 39, pp. 521-535; Bartlett, F.C., (1932) Remembering, , Oxford: Macmillan; Barton, R., Dunbar, R.I.M., Evolution of the social brain (1997) Machiavellian Intelligence II: Extensions and Evaluations, pp. 240-263. , A.

Five additional appraisals account for variation in the hedonic tone of awe experiences: threat, beauty, exceptional ability, virtue, and the supernatural. We derive this perspective from a review of what has been written about awe in religion, philosophy, sociology, and psychology, and then we apply this perspective to an analysis of awe and related states such as admiration, elevation, and the epiphanic experience.",,aptitude; awe; emotion; esthetics; experience; human; mental function; morality; priority journal; psychology; religion; review; sociology; threat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C., John, O.P., Keltner, D., Kring, A.M., Social status in groups that interact face-to-face: Effects of personality and physical attractiveness (2001) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81, pp. 116-132; Angyal, A., Disgust and related aversions (1941) Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 36, pp. 393-412; (1969), Bhagavadgita (R.C.

Recently, cognitive anthropologists have criticized such models. They make three points: mental representations are non-discrete, cultural transmission is highly inaccurate, and mental representations are not replicated, but rather are 'reconstructed' through an inferential process that is strongly affected by cognitive 'attractors.' They argue that it follows from these three claims that: 1) models that assume replication or replicators are inappropriate, 2) selective cultural learning cannot account for stable traditions, and 3) selective cultural learning cannot generate cumulative adaptation. Here we use three formal models to show that even if the premises of this critique are correct, the deductions that have been drawn from them are false. In the first model, we assume continuously varying representations under the influence of weak selective transmission and strong attractors. We show that if the attractors are sufficiently strong relative to selective forces, the continuous representation model reduces to the standard discrete-trait replicator model, and the weak selective component determines the final equilibrium of the system. In the second model, we assume inaccurate replication and discrete traits. We show that very low fidelity replication of representations at the individual level does not preclude accurate replication at the population level, and therefore, accurate individual-level replication of representations is not necessary for either cultural inertia or cumulative cultural adaptation. In the third model, we derive plausible conditions for cumulative adaptive evolution, assuming continuous cultural representations, incomplete transmission and substantial inferential transformations. © 2002 Koninklijke Brill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ATRAN, S., The trouble with memes: Inference versus imitation in cultural creation (2001) Human Nature, 12 (4), pp. 351-381; ATRAN, S., (2002) In gods we trust: The evolutionary landscape of religion, , New York: Oxford University Press; ATRAN, S., MEDIN, D., ROSS, N., LYNCH, E., VAPNARSKY, V., UCAN EK', E., COLEY, J., BARAN, M., Folkecology, cultural epidemiology, and the spirit of the commons: A garden experiment in the Maya lowlands, 1991-2001 Current Anthropology, 43 (3). , in press; BARON, R., VANDELLO, J., BRUNSMAN, B., The forgotten variable in conformity research: Impact of task importance on social influence (1996) Journal of Personality & Social Psychology, 71 (5), pp. 915-927; BLACKMORE, S., (1999) The Meme Machine, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; BOND, R., SMITH, P.B., Culture and conformity: A meta-analysis of studies using Asch's (1952b, 1956) line judgment task (1996) Psychological Bulletin, 119 (1), pp. 111-137; BOYD, R., RICHERSON, P.J., (1985) Culture and the Evolutionary Process, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; BOYD, R., RICHERSON, P.J., Memes: Universal Acid or a Better Mouse Trap (2000) Darwinizing Culture: The Status of Memetics as a Science, pp. 143-162. , R.

In the postmodern period, the grotesque becomes a kind of norm, since science is able to detect and synthesize an unprecedented number of things never before seen in nature. The science-fictional grotesque begins from this premise, embodying in its central repertoire of anomalies a host of monsters, cyborgs, and aliens. The sf grotesque usually involves a descent from intellectual apprehension of anomalies into relentlessly mutable and mutating bodies, and these are often coded as feminine challenges to phallocratic scientific rationality. The essay treats Stanislaw Lem's Solaris as a quintessential example of the literary sf-grotesque. In it, the grotesque core-object, the plasmic ocean, forces the Solarist scientists to reconceive their scientific rationality, while the narrative itself mutates from one form to another. The Alien films, by contrast, represent the spectacular sf-grotesque. In them, the bodies of the Aliens, the androids, and the humans undergo constantly metamorphosing embodiments and bodily relationships.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alien. Dir.

In addition, the prestige of artists and institutions are intertwined. Artists derive their prestige at least in part from their affiliations to art organizations, and the prestige of organizations is based on the artists which they are able to take on. This paper introduces a simple but efficient index to measure dynamic prestige from a longitudinal network of affiliations. It is shown that the prestige of literary magazines can be computed from the flow of authors between magazines and that it correlates strongly with external indicators of literary prestige. An advanced method for analyzing longitudinal networks was used to demonstrate that this index of prestige predicts the exchange of authors between magazines whereas static indices of prestige do not. The results corroborate the relational and dynamic character of positions within the literary field postulated in the field theory of Pierre Bourdieu. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

Pennsylvania, 3815 Walnut St., Philadelphia, PA 19104-6196, United States","This paper advances an ""information goods"" theory that explains prestige processes as an emergent product of psychological adaptations that evolved to improve the quality of information acquired via cultural transmission. Natural selection favored social learners who could evaluate potential models and copy the most successful among them. In order to improve the fidelity and comprehensiveness of such ranked-biased copying, social learners further evolved dispositions to sycophantically ingratiate themselves with their chosen models, so as to gain close proximity to, and prolonged interaction with, these models. Once common, these dispositions created, at the group level, distributions of deference that new entrants may adaptively exploit to decide who to begin copying. This generated a preference for models who seem generally ""popular."" Building on social exchange theories, we argue that a wider range of phenomena associated with prestige processes can more plausibly be explained by this simple theory than by others, and we test its predictions with data from throughout the social sciences. In addition, we distinguish carefully between dominance (force or force threat) and prestige (freely conferred deference). © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",Cultural transmission; Dual inheritance theory; Prestige; Prestige-biased transmission; Social learning; Status,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abramovitch, R., The relation of attention and proximity to rank in preschool children (1976) The Social Structure of Attention, pp. 153-176. , M.R.A.

The article focuses on disgust because its elicitors have been precisely described. In Study 1, with controls for informational factors like truth, people were more willing to pass along stories that elicited stronger disgust. Study 2 randomly sampled legends and created versions that varied in disgust; people preferred to pass along versions that produced the highest level of disgust. Study 3 coded legends for specific story motifs that produce disgust (e.g., ingestion of a contaminated substance) and found that legends that contained more disgust motifs were distributed more widely on urban legend Web sites. The conclusion discusses implications of emotional selection for the social marketplace of ideas.",,affect; article; decision making; human; literature; psychological theory; social environment; urbanization; Affect; Choice Behavior; Humans; Mythology; Psychological Theory; Social Environment; Urbanization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abrams v.

This is manifested in 4 ways: (a) negative potency (negative entities are stronger than the equivalent positive entities), (b) steeper negative gradients (the negativity of negative events grows more rapidly with approach to them in space or time than does the positivity of positive events, (c) negativity dominance (combinations of negative and positive entities yield evaluations that are more negative than the algebraic sum of individual subjective valences would predict), and (d) negative differentiation (negative entities are more varied, yield more complex conceptual representations, and engage a wider response repertoire). We review evidence for this taxonomy, with emphasis on negativity dominance, including literary, historical, religious, and cultural sources, as well as the psychological literatures on learning, attention, impression formation, contagion, moral judgment, development, and memory. We then consider a variety of theoretical accounts for negativity bias. We suggest that I feature of negative events that make them dominant is that negative entities are more contagious than positive entities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, E., The code of the streets (1984) Atlantic Monthly, 5, pp. 81-94; Asch, S., Forming impressions of personality (1946) Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 41, pp. 258-290; Averill, J.R., On the paucity of positive emotions (1980) Advances in the Study of Communication and Affect, 6, pp. 7-45. , K.

Many defenses seem, however, to be expressed too readily or too intensely. Furthermore, there are remarkably few untoward effects from using drugs to dampen defensive responses. A signal detection analysis of defense regulation can help to resolve this apparent paradox. When the cost of expressing an all-or-none defense is low compared to the potential harm it protects against, the optimal system will express many false alarms. Defenses with graded responses are expressed to the optimal degree when the marginal cost equals the marginal benefit, a point that may vary considerably from the intuitive optimum. Models based on these principles show that the over-responsiveness of many defenses is only apparent, but they also suggest that, in specific instances, defenses can often be dampened without compromising fitness. The smoke detector principle is an essential foundation for making decisions about when drugs can be used safely to relieve suffering and block defenses.",Anxiety; Darwinian medicine; Defenses; Evolution; Medicine; Natural selection; Pharmacology; Signal detection; Smoke detector; Stress,anxiety; conference paper; coughing; defensive behavior; evolution; flight; model; natural selection; signal detection; stress; Darwinia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sternbach, R.A., Congenital insensitivity to pain (1963) Psychol.

Bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have more impact than good ones, and bad information is processed more thoroughly than good. The self is more motivated to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good ones. Bad impressions and bad stereotypes are quicker to form and more resistant to disconfirmation than good ones. Various explanations such as diagnosticity and salience help explain some findings, but the greater power of bad events is still found when such variables are controlled. Hardly any exceptions (indicating greater power of good) can be found. Taken together, these findings suggest that bad is stronger than good, as a general principle across a broad range of psychological phenomena.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abbey, A., Abramis, D.J., Caplan, R.D., Effects of different sources of social support and social conflict on emotional well-being (1985) Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 6, pp. 111-129; Abele, A., Thinking about thinking: Causal, evaluative, and finalistic cognitions about social situations (1985) European Journal of Social Psychology, 15, pp. 315-332; Acitelli, L.K., Douvan, E., Veroff, J., Perceptions of conflict in the first year of marriage: How important are similarity and understanding?

Yet recent work on visual integration and change direction reveals that we are surprisingly unaware of the details of our environment from one view to the next: we often do not detect large changes to objects and scenes ('change blindness'). Furthermore, without attention, we may not even perceive objects ('inattentional blindness'). Taken together, these findings suggest that we perceive and remember only those objects and details that receive focused attention. In this paper, we briefly review and discuss evidence for these cognitive forms of 'blindness'. We then present a new study that builds on classic studies of divided visual attention to examine inattentional blindness for complex objects and events in dynamic scenes. Our results suggest that the likelihood of noticing an unexpected object depends on the similarity of that object to other objects in the display and on how difficult the priming monitoring task is. Interestingly, spatial proximity of the critical unattended object to attended locations does not appear to affect detection, suggesting that observers attend to objects and events, not spatial positions. We discuss the implications of these results for visual representations and awareness of our visual environment.",,"article; attention; eye fixation; human; physiology; psychologic test; vision; Attention; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Psychological Tests; Visual Perception",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bahrick, L.E., Walker, A.S., Neisser, U., Selective looking by infants (1981) Cognitive Psychology, 13, pp. 377-390; Becklen, R., Cervone, D., Selective looking and the noticing of unexpected events (1983) Memory and Cognition, 11, pp. 601-608; Cherry, E.C., Some experiments upon the recognition of speech, with one and with two ears (1953) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 25, pp. 975-979; Chun, M.M., Jiang, Y., Contextual cueing: Implicit learning and memory of visual context guides spatial attention (1998) Cognitive Psychology, 36, pp. 28-71; Currie, C., McConkie, G.W., Carlson-Radvansky, L.A., Irwin, D.E., (1995) Maintaining Visual Stability Across Saccades: Role of the Saccade Target Object, , technical report UIUC-BI-HPP-95-01, Beckman Institute, University of Illinois; Grimes, J., On the failure to detect changes in scenes across saccades (1996) Perception (Vancouver Studies in Cognitive Science), 2, pp. 89-110. , Ed.

To test whether this negativity bias operates at the evaluative categorization stage, the authors recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs), which are more sensitive to the evaluative categorization than the response output stage, as participants viewed positive, negative, and neutral pictures. Results revealed larger amplitude late positive brain potentials during the evaluative categorization of (a) positive and negative stimuli as compared with neutral stimuli and (b) negative as compared with positive stimuli, even though both were equally probable, evaluatively extreme, and arousing. These results provide support for the hypothesis that the negativity bias in affective processing occurs as early as the initial categorization into valence classes.",,"adult; affect; arousal; article; attention; brain cortex; electroencephalography; evoked visual response; female; hemispheric dominance; human; male; pattern recognition; physiology; Adult; Affect; Arousal; Attention; Cerebral Cortex; Dominance, Cerebral; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Female; Humans; Male; Pattern Recognition, Visual",,,,,"National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH: P50MH052384",,,,,,,,,,,,"Ito, T.A.",,,,,,,,223514,,,9825526,English,J Pers Soc Psychol,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032174997

K7L 3N6, Canada","We review empirical and conceptual developments over the past four years (1992-1995) on attitudes and persuasion. A voluminous amount of material was produced concerning attitude structure, attitude change, and the consequences of holding attitudes. In the structure area, particular attention is paid to work on attitude accessiblity, ambivalence, and the affective versus cognitive bases of attitudes. In persuasion, our review examines research that has focused on high effort cognitive processes (central route), low effort processes (peripheral route), and the multiple roles by which variables can have an impact on attitudes. Special emphasis is given to work on cognitive dissonance and other biases in message processing, and on the multiple processes by which mood influences evaluations. Work on the consequences of attitudes focuses on the impact of attitudes on behavior and social judgments.",Affect; Attitude structure; Bias; Evaluation; Persuasion,affect; attitude; cognition; human; motivation; persuasive communication; review; Affect; Attitude; Cognition; Humans; Motivation; Persuasive Communication,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aitken, C.K., McMahon, T.A., Wearing, A.J., Finlayson, B.L., Residential water use: Predicting and reducing consumption (1994) J.

The 1st, in the 1960s, focused mainly on curiosity's psychological underpinnings. The 2nd, in the 1970s and 1980s, was characterized by attempts to measure curiosity and assess its dimensionality. This article reviews these contributions with a concentration on the 1st wave. It is argued that theoretical accounts of curiosity proposed during the 1st period fell short in 2 areas: They did not offer an adequate explanation for why people voluntarily seek out curiosity, and they failed to delineate situational determinants of curiosity. Furthermore, these accounts did not draw attention to, and thus did not explain, certain salient characteristics of curiosity: its intensity, transience, association with impulsivity, and tendency to disappoint when satisfied. A new account of curiosity is offered that attempts to address these shortcomings. The new account interprets curiosity as a form of cognitively induced deprivation that arises from the perception of a gap in knowledge or understanding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Loewenstein, G.; Department of Social and Decision Sciences, , Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890, United States",,,,,,,,332909,,PSBUA,,English,Psychol.

To test whether attentional resources are automatically directed away from an attended task to undesirable stimuli, Ss named the colors in which desirable and undesirable traits (e. g., honest, sadistic) appeared. Across 3 experiments, color-naming latencies were consistently longer for undesirable traits but did not differ within the desirable and undesirable categories. In Experiment 2, Ss also showed more incidental learning for undesirable traits, as predicted by the automatic vigilance (but not a perceptual defense) hypothesis. In Experiment 3, a diagnosticity (or base-rate) explanation of the vigilance effect was ruled out.
